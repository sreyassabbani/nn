# Neural Networks

This repository hosts code for my "playground" for learning neural networks. Implementing concepts from scratch is cool, so that's what I'm doing here.

Currently, I'm working on building a somewhat fast[^1] Rust library from the ground up (yes, no external math libraries) with API design and "parse, don't validate" as a large focus.

- Multi-layer perceptrons
- Convolutional neural networks
- Automatic differentiation

And possibly a lot more in the future

[^1]: yes. and also: we don't talk about Rust compile times
